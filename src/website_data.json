      "description": "I am a 21 year-old IT student finishing my undergraduate studies at NWU Vanderbijilpark in 2020.",

      "about_me": "I am passionate about learning more about the IT field and concepts and skills that are relevant to it. I take pride in the planning of my work and I am motivated in reaching the goals I laid out for myself while remaining flexible and open-minded when I stumble upon problems. I find myself drawn to leadership positions where I can properly delegate tasks among group members and establish a healthy group dynamic; it is important for me to be able to trust my group members and vice versa. I am orientated in receiving results and I believe that I should take responsibility by completing tasks through researching the concepts I will be working with, as well as consulting others when I face a difficult task. I enjoy learning more and I find myself looking forward to the next opportunity or challenge that comes my way.",
